    </p>

    <h3>MARKETING</h3>

    <p>
      We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data
      uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We may use your
      contact details and technical data that we collect about you, such as your
      IP address and the way you browse our website to form a view on what we
      think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how
      we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we
      call this marketing).
    </p>
    <p>
      You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested
      information from us or purchased goods or services through us or if you
      provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered
      for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving
      that marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by
      following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by
      contacting us at any time at {{ getEmail }}.
    </p>

      with any external company for marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</h3>

    <p>
      We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
      collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
      another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If
      you wish to know how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with
      the original purpose, please email us at {{ getEmail }}.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will
      notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge
      or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or
      permitted by law.
    </p>

        </ul>
      </li>

      required or permitted by law, we will not share, sell, or distribute any
      of the information you provide us without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will disclose your personal information (i) to any third party to whom
      disclosure is necessary to enable us to fulfil your orders and provide you
      with any service which you have subscribed to; (ii) where required to do
      so by law or court order; and (iii) to any person to whom disclosure is

      under our
      <router-link :to="{ name: 'terms' }">
        <strong>Terms and Conditions</strong> </router-link
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      This includes when:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        We sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we will disclose

        or assets.
      </li>
      <li>
        The company or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third

          <strong>Website Terms and Conditions</strong>
        </router-link>
        and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of
        the company, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging
        information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of
        fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>WHERE DO WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

    <p>
      All personal data we process is processed by our staff in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of IT hosting and maintenance this information is located
      on servers inside the EEA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our external third party, Sendgrid is based outside the European Economic
      Area (EEA), so their processing of your personal data will involve
      transferring your data outside the EEA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
      similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of
      the following safeguards is implemented:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts
        approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same
        protection it has in Europe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if
        they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide
        similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the
        US.
      </li>
      <li>
        Appropriate security measures will be adopted to protect your
        information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful
        processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please contact us at {{ getEmail }} if you want further information on the
      specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of
      the EEA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have received your information, we have a Data Protection regime
      in place to oversee the effective and secure processing of your personal
      data and we will use strict procedures and security features to try to
      prevent unauthorised access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
      completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
      data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our
      website at transmission stage; any transmission is at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h3>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR?</h3>

    <p>
      We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil
      the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying
      any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We generally retain your
      data for 6 years or less.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
      consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
      potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
      personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
      whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
      applicable legal requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are required under UK tax law to keep basic personal data about our
      customers (name, address, contact details) for a minimum of six (6) years
      after which time it will be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can
      no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in
      which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice
      to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can ask us to delete your data in some circumstances. See below for
      further information.
    </p>

    <h3>WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?</h3>

    <p>
      Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in
      relation to your personal data:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
      <li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
      <li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS</h3>

    <p>
      If you wish to exercise any of your rights set out above, please email us
      at {{ getEmail }}.
    </p>
    <p>
      We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
      Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
      particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case,
      we will notify you and keep you updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
      exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee
      if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
      Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
      circumstances.
    </p>
